# kof96

Disassembly of 熱闘 ザ・キング・オブ・ファイターズ ’９６ / Nettou King of Fighters '96 for the Game Boy.

This will build a bit-perfect ROM of KOF96. You can verify this by providing a ROM named "Nettou The King of Fighters '96 (Japan) (SGB Enhanced).gb" as "original.gb".

-------------

To assemble, run the included batch script "build.cmd"

Once again, thanks to lazigamer for the debug emulator used to generate the initial CDL.
